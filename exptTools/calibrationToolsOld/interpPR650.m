function [measure, wavelengths] = interpPR650(measureRaw)% % [measure, wavelengths] = interpPR650(measureRaw)% %AUTHOR: Poirson%DATE:   11.07.97% % This function converts the raw PR-650 measurements into the form we% conventionally use at Stanford for our color calculations.  The% interpolated values are in watts/sr/m^2/nm.  % %   To compute candelas/m2 from the returned vector, measure, use the formula% %     L (cd/m^2) = 683 * Integral [ V(lambda)*Radiance(lambda) dLambda]% %  or, in matlab terms, candm2 = 683 * vlambda' * measure% % Why is there a 683?  Because 1 watt/sr/m^2 at the peak of% vLambda (555nm) is defined to be 683 cd/m^2 by the CIE.% %ARGUMENTS:%   INPUT:%   measureRaw:   Data produced by the PR-650.  This is a Nx2 matrix.  The first%                 column contains the wavelength positions and the second column%                 contains the measured values in watts/sr/m^2.  The wavelengths%                 always run from 380-780 in 4nm steps.% %   RETURNS:%   %   measure:     These are interpolated data%   wavelengths: These are the wavelengths, so that%      plot(wavelengths,measure) is the result%   % %CHANGES:% % 09.09.98 (BW):  I updated the values to maintain the correct% physical units.  The returns were made column vectors.% %   Discussion:% % The values the PR 650 file are measured in watts/sr/m^2/4nm% band  The relationship between this quantity and candelas/m^2% is % %     L (cd/m^2) = 683 * Integral [ V(lambda)*Radiance(lambda) dLambda]% %  with radiance measured in watts/sr/m^2/lambda% % Since the data are in 4nm wide bands, when we interpolate to 1% nm bands we should divide by 4.  Then we multiply by 683.  The% combination of these two operations is approximately 170 ~% 683/4. % % 12.01.97 (ABP) You might want to multiply measurements by 170% so that dot product with XYZ produces proper photometric values.% I don't know why this seems to be the magic scale factor.% disp('InterpPR650 was updated to use the correct units on Sept. 9, 1998');disp('See Wandell if you have any questions.')  % PR-650 data start in range [380-780] in increments of 4nm.  The% units are watts/sr/m^2 per 4nm band.  Our goal is to create a% file that runs from 370 to 730 for consistency with our% software.  This might be a mistake, but there you have it.prWave	= measureRaw(:,1);	% Measured wavelengths in nmprValues= measureRaw(:,2);	% Measured values in watts/sr/m^2% linearly interpolate over the range that intersects the % PR range (380:780) and what we use (370:730) to get 1nm spacing% w1nm 	= [380:730];mInterp	= interp1(prWave,prValues,w1nm)/4;% Zero pad front of interpolated spectrum% zeroPadFront = zeros(10,1)';waveFront = [370:379];wavelengths = [waveFront,w1nm]';measure     = [zeroPadFront, mInterp]';return
